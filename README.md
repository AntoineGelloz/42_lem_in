# Lem_in üêú
In this 42 school project, we designed and implemented an algorithm to solve a special case of a maximum flow problem in graph theory.</br>
The goal is to find the optimal flow of ants through an anthill that minimizes the number of rounds needed to traverse the anthill.</br>
An anthill is described as a network composed of 'rooms' (graph nodes) and 'tunnels' (edges) linking the rooms together, with all ants starting and finishing at two precise rooms.</br>
The real trouble begins when each room can welcome only one ant at a time (except for the start and end rooms).</br>
A round ends when no more ants are able to start or move any further in the anthill.

### Inspired by Edmonds‚ÄìKarp

For each round of the algorithm, an augmenting path is found, increasing the potential flow of ants through the anthill. Edmonds-Karp algorithm chooses the next augmenting path using breadth-first search (BFS). If there are multiple augmenting paths to choose from, Edmonds-Karp garantees to select the shortest path from source to sink. Once there are no remaining paths found, the algorithm ends.

We decided to design a tweaked version of the BFS to allow backtracking on a node already included in a selected augmenting path. We were able to find more paths than with regular Edmonds-Karp, thus improving the algorithm efficiency. Below is a case in point. The regular BFS will only find the path on Fig. 1. For a number of ants greater than 2, this is not the best solution. Our modified BFS will find the two paths on Fig. 2:

### Linear programming model

Once all the augmenting paths are found, we have to decide which paths to use in order to minimize the number of rounds given the number of ants. We consider the following : 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agelloz/42-Lem_in/master/img/model.png)

At the beginning, C is set to the length of the shortest path. For each incremental value of C, we try to solve the following equations system:

Until a feasible solution is found, we increment C. We finally know how many ants will flow on each path.

## Algorithm
```
Modified Edmonds-Karp with BFS searching for paths minimizing the lines of output

function main(options):
	parse the arguments for any display options
	parse the file from stdin (get ants number, rooms and tunnels)
	build the graph data structure with an adjacency list with all edge's capacities at 1
	if (parsing error):
		print error and exit
	initialize paths list to null
	paths = find_paths(graph)
	if (no solution is found):
		print error and exit
	print the file on stdout
	assign each ant to a path
	let the ants pass into the graph by printing one line of output for each round on stdout
	display any options from arguments

function find_paths(graph):
	initialize paths list to null
	new_path = bfs(graph)
	append new_path to paths list
	reduce capacities of the new_path forward edges
	increase capacities of the new_path backward edges
	compute the initial lines of output using only this new_path
	point to the new_path as selected_path
	while (selected_path did not reach the end of the paths list):
		store the previous number of paths found
		new_path = bfs(graph, selected_path)
		compute the new lines of output
		if (the new output is minimized):
			update the count of lines of output
			append new_paths to paths
			reduce capacities of the new_path forward edges to 0
			increase capacities of the new_path backward edges to 2
			point selected_path to first path
		else:
			discard new_path
			point selected_path to next path
	return (paths)

function bfs(graph, selected_path):
	create a queue and add start_room
	create a prev[size of graph] array to keep track of previous rooms when enqueued
	while (queue is not empty):
		room = dequeue(queue)
		for each (neighbours of room NOT already enqueued):
			if (room is NOT on selected_path AND NOT end_room):
				if (neighbour is on selected_path AND NOT a start_room neighbour):
					mark neighbour as visited
					mark neighbour as already enqueued
					update prev[neighbour] = room
					select neighbour2 as the previous room of neighbour on the selected_path
					enqueue(neighbour, neighbour2)
				else if (neighbour is NOT visited):
					enqueue(room, neighbour)
			else if (room is on selected_path
					AND (edge to neighbour has a capacity of 2 AND NOT start_room
						|| edge to neighbour has a capacity of 1 AND NOT visited)):
				enqueue(room, neighbour)
	return (reconstruct_path(graph, prev))

function reconstruct_path(graph, prev):
	initialize new_paths list to null
	room = end_room
	while (room exists):
		add room to new_path list
		room = prev[room]
	if (the first room of new_path is start):
		reset all rooms visited on the new_path
		return (new_path)
	else:
		reset all rooms visited
		return (null)

function enqueue(room, neighbour):
	mark neighbour as visited
	mark neighbour as already enqueued
	update prev[neighbour] = room
	enqueue(neighbour)
```

## Building
Build the `libft.a` static library and the `lem-in` binary by executing `make` in the cloned repo.

## Dependencies (for the visual only)
* PHP
* Google Chrome

## Usage
A map with a precise format is sent to the `lem-in` program as `stdin` input:
```
./lem-in [-h --help] [-a --anthill] [-p --paths] [-v --visual] < maps/demo_map
```
### Map format
```
5		<< ants number
##start		<< start room is following
r0 1 2
r1 2 3
r2 3 4
r3 4 5
r4 3 5
r5 6 7
r6 8 9
r7 7 9
##end		<< end room is following
r8 90 1
r0-r1		<< tunnels
r1-r2
r2-r8
r0-r6
#comment	<< optional comments at any line
r6-r7
r1-r6
r1-r4
r4-r8
r0-r3
r3-r2
r2-r5
r5-r8
```
Many more examples are provided in the `/maps` repository.

### Options
* -h --help : Display usage
* -a --anthill : Display the anthill rooms and tunnels
* -p --paths : Display the paths found by the algorithm
* -v --visual : Display the visual in a new Google Chrome tab

## Output
The output of the program is divided in two parts:
* the file read from `stdin`
* one line per round (output to minimize). It represents the movements of ants with the format `LX-Y` (`X` being the ant's number and `Y` the room's name).
