# lem_in
Lem_in is an algorithm project about solving a special case of a maximun flow problem in network optimization.
The goal is to find a feasible flow of ants through an anthill that minimizes the number of movement rounds.
An anthill is described as a network composed of 'rooms' (graph nodes) and 'tunnels' (graph edges) linking the rooms together.
The real trouble begins when each room can welcome only ONE ant at a time (except for Start and End).
A round ends when no more ants are able to move any further.
